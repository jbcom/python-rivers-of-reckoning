# CLAUDE.md - Rivers of Reckoning [PYTHON STANDALONE]

> **"A hero's legacy is written in the steps they take against the Reckoning."**

## 🌊 The Standalone Vision: The Legend of Rivers

**Rivers of Reckoning** is a personal tribute turned into an atmospheric roguelike. While the TypeScript "Rivermarsh" focuses on literal geography, this Python standalone is the **Saga of Rivers**—a character-driven journey through a world that actively reacts to your progress.

### How we differ from "Rivermarsh" (TS):
1.  **The Protagonist's Burden**: The game is about the character "Rivers" (named for the creator's stepson) and his struggle against the **Reckoning**.
2.  **The Reckoning Meter**: A unique "destiny" mechanic. The world grows more hostile not just because of where you are, but because of who you are and how long you've survived.
3.  **Fate's Pull**: What was once "Water Flow" is now **The Flow of Fate**—a physical force representing the world's attempt to steer Rivers off his path.
4.  **Legendary Aesthetic**: High-contrast, moody colors (Deep Void, Reckoning Red, Sulfur) that feel like an old chronicle or a dark legend.

### Unique Standalone Goals

1.  **Character Growth**: Focus on the leveling and gear progression of Rivers.
2.  **Destiny Events**: The Reckoning triggers "Trials" (surges) that test the player's resolve.
3.  **Personalized UI**: A "Chronicle" style HUD that tracks the legend of the current run.
4.  **Juice & Feedback**: Aggressive screen shake and tactical "impact" frames to make every victory feel hard-earned.
