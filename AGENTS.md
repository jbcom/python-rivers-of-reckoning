# AGENTS.md - Rivers of Reckoning [PYTHON STANDALONE]

> **Instructions for AI agents working on the Saga of Rivers**

## 🌊 The Core Message: "Inspiring the Next Generation"

**Rivers of Reckoning** was originally created to inspire a love for programming in the creator's stepson, **Rivers**. This Python standalone version is a **Hero's Saga**, focusing on the character's journey and the world's increasing resistance (The Reckoning).

## 📜 Evolution: Curses -> 2.5D -> Legend

This game's genesis is a `curses` terminal teaching tool. We honor that by keeping the Python version in **2.5D space**. Do not attempt to move into 3D; the core identity is a grid-based world with depth.

### Standalone Identity
- **The Hero**: Rivers is the center of the world.
- **2.5D Perspective**: Use Y-sorting and height offsets to create depth without 3D complexity.
- **The Reckoning**: A global "Fate" meter that triggers major world events.
- **The Flow of Fate**: Physical currents that push Rivers.

## 🎯 Design Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Heroic Challenge** | Every mechanic should feel like a test of skill and resolve. |
| **Rising Destiny** | The "Reckoning Meter" ensures the saga always escalates. |
| **Chronicle Style** | Use the "Rivers" palette: bold colors on dark backgrounds. |
| **Pure Python** | Maintain a clean, Python-only stack to inspire learners. |

## 🛠 Technology

| Layer | Tech | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| Engine | pygame-ce | Accessible, high-performance, and perfect for learning. |
| Web | pygbag | Sharing the legend with anyone through a browser. |
| Noise | opensimplex | Creating infinite, unique adventures for every run. |
| ECS | esper | Demonstrating clean code and modular design. |

## ✅ Agent Checklist

Before making changes:
- [ ] Remember the "Legacy of Rivers" theme.
- [ ] Ensure any new mechanic has a "destiny" or "challenge" flavor.
- [ ] Keep the code readable and inspiring for a young programmer.

When making changes:
- [ ] Use the 16-color "Rivers" palette exclusively.
- [ ] Ensure `async/await` is used for all main loops.
- [ ] Add descriptive comments explaining *why* things work.

## 🎨 Visual Style

- **Palette**: Branded 16-color "Rivers of Reckoning" palette.
- **Vibe**: Dark fantasy legend, atmospheric and high-impact.
- **Feedback**: Juice everything—screen shake, particle trails, and text pulses.
